# README-Generator

---

## Description

This command-line application dynamically generates a professional README.md file based on user input using the Inquirer package.

The README Generator simplifies the task of creating a well-structured README.md file for your open-source projects on GitHub. With a few simple prompts, you can create a README that includes essential sections such as project description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and licensing information.

## Installation

To install this application, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

After installation, run the command `node index.js` to start the application. Follow the prompts to enter information about your project. Once all prompts are completed, a professional README.md file will be generated in the root directory of your project.

The following [walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/_p2UB7m8zAE) demonstrates the functionality of the application.
